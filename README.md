# Fruits-and-Vegetables-Recognition-System

## About Dataset

### Context
This dataset contains images of various fruits and vegetables, including:

**Fruits:** banana, apple, pear, grapes, orange, kiwi, watermelon, pomegranate, pineapple, mango.

**Vegetables:** cucumber, carrot, capsicum, onion, potato, lemon, tomato, radish, beetroot, cabbage, lettuce, spinach, soybean, cauliflower, bell pepper, chili pepper, turnip, corn, sweetcorn, sweet potato, paprika, jalape√±o, ginger, garlic, peas, eggplant.

### Content
The dataset comprises three main folders:

- **train** (100 images each)
- **test** (10 images each)
- **validation** (10 images each)

Each of these folders contains subfolders for different fruits and vegetables, where the respective food item images are stored.

### Data Collection
The images in this dataset were scraped from Kaggle Dataset for a project.

## Inspiration
This project aims to develop a robust food recognition system specifically focused on identifying various fruits and vegetables.

## Project Highlights:

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The project includes a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase, delving into the characteristics of the dataset. EDA provides insights into the distribution, patterns, and potential challenges within the data, offering a foundation for informed decisions during model development.

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model
To achieve accurate and reliable food item recognition, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is employed. CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks, making them an ideal choice for this project. The model undergoes training on the provided dataset to learn the distinctive features of each food item.

### Evaluation of Results
After model training, the project conducts a thorough evaluation to assess the performance of the CNN model. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are considered to gauge the model's effectiveness in correctly identifying fruits and vegetables.

This project not only serves as a valuable resource for food recognition research but also provides a foundation for potential applications, such as developing a mobile application that identifies food items from images and suggests recipes based on the recognized items.
